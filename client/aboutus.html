    <p>We are Blakes Building Solutions, founded by Ryan Blake who has been
      specialising in the building and renovation business for over 15 years.
       Ryan has been passionate about historic buildings from a young age.
       Growing up in France, he developed a love for French architecture
       and it’s thanks to this and his father’s infectious love of the industry
        that he decided to carve a career as a specialist in renovation.</p>

      <p>These days, Ryan has a diverse business with projects ranging from creating
         period extensions to designing and building a sleek modern beach house.
         One of Ryan’s passions is sourcing material from unusual places in order to
         give a property a unique feel. He has been known to drive as far away as
         France to purchase a specific radiator and to various reclamation yards to
         search for a hidden gem that will give personality to his clients project.</p>
